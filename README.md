# klaviyo-shopify-hydrogen-example-code

This repository contains sample code components for enabling client side tracking functionality for the Klaviyo/Shopify integration, specifically onsite tracking for a Hydrogen storefront to supplement the prebuilt Klaviyo/Shopify integration that relies the Shopify backend. This guide assume you have read the [Integrate with a Shopify Hydrogen store](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/integrate-with-a-shopify-hydrogen-store) developer guide and have already connected Klaviyoâ€™s native Shopify integration.

The example code is based on the [Hydrogen Demo Store](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/templates#demo-store-template) as an easy-to-use baseline for any Hydrogen-powered storefront.

## Adding the Code

Copy the `klaviyo` folder into the `src/components` directory of your root project folder. This directory contains three client files.
   - `KlaviyoOnsite.client.jsx` - Enables loading the Klaviyo onsite script for track/identify requests and sign-up forms. Also enables subscriptions to various on site analytics. Make sure to change the `API_KEY` to your Klaviyo _public_ API key.
   - `KlaviyoPublishProductView.client.jsx` - Publishes a product view metric. To be added on project page.
   - `KlaviyoIdentify.client.jsx` - Enables Klaviyo to identify a user for onsite event tracking.

## Adding the Initial Script

In `src/App.server.jsx` import the KlaviyoOnsite component and add at the end of the `<LocalizationProvider />` tag:

```javascript
import KlaviyoOnsite from '~/components/klaviyo/KlaviyoOnsite.client';
// Omitted
export default function Layout({children, hero}) {
    // Omitted
    return (
        <LocalizationProvider preload="*">
            Omitted
            <KlaviyoOnsite />
        </LocalizationProvider>
    );
}
```

## Adding Product Publishing for `Viewed Product` and `Viewed Item` Tracking

The example code makes use of [Hydrogen Analytics](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/framework/analytics)and uses the `VIEWED_PRODUCT` event notification to be triggered, which can be done with Hydrogen's built in `ClientAnalytics`. For example in `src/routes/products/[handle].server.jsx` add the following function and add to the end of `ProductProvider`:

```javascript
import KlaviyoPublishProductView from '~/components/klaviyo/KlaviyoPublishProductView.client';
// Omitted
export default function Product() {
    // Omitted
    return (
        <Layout>
            <Suspense>
                <Seo type="product" data={product} />
            </Suspense>
            <ProductOptionsProvider data={product}>
                // Omitted
                <KlaviyoPublishProductView product={product} />
            </ProductOptionsProvider>
        </Layout>
    );            
}
```

_Note_: The product context is assumed to be at the variant product level to have access to properties such as `selectedVariant`.

### Adding Collections to Product Query

Klaviyo also tracks product collection titles, which is not part of the example GraphQL query in the demo-store. If you're using the Shopify [demo-store](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/blob/v1.x-2022-07/templates/demo-store/src/routes/products/%5Bhandle%5D.server.jsx), the addition would look like the following:

```javascript
const QUERY = gql`
    query product(
        $country: CountryCode
        $language: LanguageCode
        $handle: String!
    ) @inContext(country: $country, language: $language) {
        product: product(handle: $handle) {
            # Omitted
            # Adding first 10 collection titles for given product to query
            collections(first: 10) {
                edges {
                    node {
                        title
                    }
                }
            }
            # Omitted
        }
    }
    `;
```

## Identifying Users
Klaviyo has multiple ways to identify users for onsite tracking. One such way is when the account details pages is accessed or the user logs in/creates an account. In `src/routes/account/index.server.jsx` add the `KlaviyoIdentify` component:

```javascript
import KlaviyoIdentify from '~/components/klaviyo/KlaviyoIdentify.client';
// Omitted
function AuthenticatedAccount({customer,}) {
    // Omitted
    return (
        <Layout>
            // Omitted
            <KlaviyoIdentify customer={customer} />
        </Layout>
    );
}
